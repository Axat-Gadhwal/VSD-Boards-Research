## Let's start 

A RGB Led is a type of led which has 4 pins : A GND, red, green and blue.

- It is differnet from other leds becaus eit can light 3 colours.

**We cam understand the difference between an led and an RGB Led by the following illustration:**

## Project Overview

### ðŸ”Œ Basic Wiring for RGB LED to FPGA

| **RGB LED Pin**       | **Connect To**                                      | **Description**                    |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Common Cathode (-)     | GND (on the VSD Squadoron FM)                       | Common ground for all colors       |
| Red Pin                | FPGA I/O Pin (e.g., Pin 18) via 220Î© resistor       | Controls Red light                 |
| Green Pin              | FPGA I/O Pin (e.g., Pin 19) via 220Î© resistor       | Controls Green light               |
| Blue Pin               | FPGA I/O Pin (e.g., Pin 48) via 220Î© resistor       | Controls Blue light                |


### ðŸ§· Step-by-Step Wiring

- Find the Common Pin of the RGB LED (longest pin usually).
- Connect the Common Pin to GND (GND Pin) on your FPGA.

### Connect:

1. Red leg â†’ 220Î© Resistor â†’ FPGA Pin 18
2. Green leg â†’ 220Î© Resistor â†’ FPGA Pin 19
3. Blue leg â†’ 220Î© Resistor â†’ FPGA Pin 48

- Resistor is important to protect each color from burning out.

### ðŸ”¥ Important Notes:

- If nothing lights up, check whether your LED is Common Anode type (rare in kits).
- Always use resistors for each color!
- If colors are dim, slightly reduce resistor value (like 150Î©).

## Steps for Implementing the code

On your Virtual Machine, type : 

`make clean; make build; sudo make flash`
